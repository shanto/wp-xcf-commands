Adds a set of new search results to the site editor command palette (CMD+K/Ctrl+K) for all custom types except those ignored from the settings page.

== Description ==

WordPress has a great time-saving feature— the command palette. It is very useful to perform quick commands and also navigate between pages or posts using keyboard alone. However, this built-in feature is limited to the default Posts and Pages types. It does not return entries from other content types. So, those using the site editor with Custom Types setup, this is workflow partially breaks.

CPT Commands fills the gap. Side-by-side with WordPress default types, it injects **custom type** entries into the menu. Requires no setup. Just install, activate and you are good to go!
